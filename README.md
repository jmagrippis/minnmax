# MinnMax

An unofficial hub for [MinnMax], the Patreon for games, friends and getting better. A hobby project mostly to play around with [SvelteKit]!

[sveltekit]: https://kit.svelte.dev/docs 'Like Next.js, for Svelte!'

## Developing

Once you've checked out this repo and installed dependencies with `npm install`, start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## External resources

I have no affiliation or real expertise with Svelte: I do like it and I want to build more apps with it ðŸ˜„
